The program was made with this tutorial and expanded to add functionality, making the game more similar to the original NES game. Made with Python.

I made the colours and tetrominoes always correspond to each other, rather than being randomly generated. I want to add an 'up next' bar to see which piece will be played next, like in the original. This will mean generating two new pieces each round and having the second piece 'become' the first. I could also change the aesthetics of the project to match NES Tetris a bit more accurately.
